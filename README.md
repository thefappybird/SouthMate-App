Hello, this is my Capstone Project on SouthMate. SouthMate is an online banking service of some sorts that is exclusively used within schools. In this project, I am focusing on creating the website with my school, USPF as the base. The app will include a Website and a mobile app.

This is for the Mobile App
The app is built by React Native, Node and MongoDB as the main languages.
